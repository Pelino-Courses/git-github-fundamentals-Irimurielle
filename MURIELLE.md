# GITHUB OVERVIEW
I learnt that Github is where developers host their code **repositories(projects)**, collaborate with others, and track issues(errors)
and bug reports. 
It eases public opinions about your app or website using **pull request** and **committing**.
It can also act as a storage since you can **push** your project and incase you lose it, you can **clone** it on your local computer.
It helps developers work remote since **collaboration** helps them share ideas and making change through **branches**
What is still confusing me is 'pull request' because it's compicated.
